Open or create a new Loyalty Program in the **Sales/Products/Discount & Loyalty** menu.

There's two ways to add a condition based on orders:
- On the program itself, allowing to define `global` conditions (valid for all rules)\
  &rarr; Find and edit the **Based on Order** field on the **Loyalty Program** form view.
- On the rule, allowing to define conditions valid for a given rule only\
  &rarr; Open or create a new **Loyalty Rule**, and edit the **Based on Order** field.
